        <p> Dear Diary,</p><br>
        <p id="f">I heard something from my youngest today
                                    that made me so sad...</p><br> 
        <p id="f">"The Sandlot" a film from 1993.
                                    Such a great movie.</p><br>
        <p id="f"> My oldest was born in 1991 and 
                                    he grew up watching this film along with panda,
                                     my middle child, who was born in 96.</p> 
     <p id="f"> It was watched countless times in our home.</p>

                            <p> Dear Diary,</p><br>
                            <p id="s"> I've been really productive today,</p>
                            <p id="s">a nice change of pace from my last two weeks
                                    of depression and lethargy.</p> <br>
                            <p id="s"> I feel something good is about to happen, 
                                    and I can't help but feel positive.</p><br>
                            <p id="s"> Unfortunately, I know this is temporary,
                                    but I like this feeling...</p>

                            <p id="t">I'll be reorganizing this place for days to reclaim my 
                                    standards.</p><br>
                            <p id="t">But it didn't turn to chaos in a day
                                    My deep depression is lifting.</p>
