                <p> <b> August 27, 2019</b> <br> Dear Diary,
    I heard something from my youngest today
     that made me so sad...
    "The Sandlot" a film from 1993.
     Such a great movie.  
     My oldest was born in 1991 and 
     he grew up watching this film along with panda,
      my middle child, who was born in 96. 
      It was watched countless times in our home.
       So much so that "You're killing me Smalls"
        was a staple in our conversations. K tells me that 
        her dad said he has never seen this movie. Are you
         fucking kidding me?!?! Where was he? Fucking ass. 
         Like I warned him, "they grow up fast. 
         You don't want to miss it." Looks like he did.... sigh.</p>  <br>
